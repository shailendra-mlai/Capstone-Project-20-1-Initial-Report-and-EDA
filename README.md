#### Executive summary
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assist part-time or hobby traders in making informed decisions regarding S&P 500 stocks. Leveraging historical stock price data and external factors such as news and trends, the model will provide recommendations on whether to hold, buy, or sell stocks. Data will be sourced from Kaggle datasets and APIs like Yahoo Finance. Time series forecasting techniques and classifiers will be employed for analysis, with the goal of streamlining decision-making and reducing the time required for stock analysis. The outcome will be a user-friendly app that facilitates efficient stock trading decisions. Users can input the stock tickers they hold or monitor, and the model will offer recommendations on optimal selling times for held stocks and opportune moments for purchasing monitored stocks.

#### Rationale
For part-time or hobby traders predicting which stock to hold, buy or sell could be time consuming process. Will the stock price go up or down based on news, companiesâ€™ financial results, should I hold the stock for dividends. 

#### Research Question
Can we develop a model to predict whether to hold, buy, or sell S&P 500 stocks based on historical data and external factors like news and trends?
Users will input their held or monitored stock tickers, and the model will provide recommendations for optimal selling times for held stocks and opportune moments for purchasing monitored stocks. Leveraging historical data, news sentiment, and market trends, the model aims to empower users with personalized insights to enhance their trading decisions and potentially maximize investment returns.

#### Data Sources
* Kaggle Massive Yahoo Finance Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iveeaten3223times/massive-yahoo-finance-dataset
*	Kaggle S&P500 Stock Prices: Historical stock price data of all S&P500 companies: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rprkh15/sp500-stock-prices/
*	Also extract the data using APIs https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/ from https://finance.yahoo.com/


#### Methodology
The methodology for forecasting stock prices combines time series techniques with machine learning methods for buy, sell, or hold recommendations. Initially, historical stock price data is analyzed to identify yearly and weekly trends, as well as correlations between different company stocks to understand sector-wide impacts. Subsequently, pmdarima is employed for automated selection of optimal ARIMA parameters, followed by model training and evaluation on separate datasets. Finally, forecasts are generated for future stock prices using the trained model, facilitating informed decision-making for traders

#### Results
The model was evaluated using ARIMA and forecasted using STLForecast, leveraging the pmdarima and statsmodels package. pmdarima automates the process of finding optimal ARIMA(p, d, q) parameters, while statsmodels requires manual parameter optimization. This automated approach streamlines the modeling process and eliminates the need for manual parameter tuning, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in forecasting.
The trained models will enable traders to make more informed decisions, reducing the time required for stock analysis.

#### Next steps
Explore additional features that may influence stock price movements, such as technical indicators such as moving averages, relative strength index, macroeconomic indicators like interest rates, GDP growth, and sentiment analysis of news and social media.
Develop risk management strategies to mitigate potential losses, such as setting stop-loss orders, diversifying investment portfolios, and incorporating risk-adjusted return metrics into the decision-making process.
Exploring LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) for stock price forecasting entails leveraging the network's ability to capture complex temporal dependencies in historical stock price data. By training an LSTM model on historical stock price sequences, it can learn patterns and trends that may indicate future price movements. 
An app created using https://streamlit.io/ could allow users to input a stock symbol and receive a recommendation.
